ALL X AND Y COORDINATES START WITH TOP LEFT CORNER AT 0,0, BOTTOM RIGHT AT 19,10

levels.txt and test_levels.txt
-contains a series of levels in 20x11 bits, with the player's respawn position X Y and goal position X Y

all_trainin.txt and all_testin.txt
-one-dimensional input values to a neural network
-contains 225 values:
--20x11=220 values representing the level
--X and Y coordinates for current position and goal position
--one value for bias

2d_trainin.txt and 2d_testin.txt
-two-dimensional input values to a neural network
-the same levels and current position as in their one-dimensional counterparts
-contains 220 values in a 20x11 matrix:
--0.0 if that grid spot is empty
--0.33 if that grid spot if blocked
--0.66 for current player position
--1.0 for goal position


all_trainout.txt and all_testout.txt
-contains four non-exclusive values representing U D L R
-desired output of that row's input in all_trainin.txt and all_testin.txt, respectively
-can also be used with 2d_trainin.txt, 2d_testin.txt


all_trainout_8.txt and all_testout_8.txt
-contains eight exclusive values representing U D L R UL UR DL DR
-adapted from all_trainout.txt and all_testout.txt with write_output_8vec.py
-desired output of that row's input in all_trainin.txt and all_testin.txt, respectively
-can also be used with 2d_trainin.txt and 2d_testin.txt
